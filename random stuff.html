The steps above only give you a working introduction to the GitHub service (both Desktop app and website) and Git as a version control system in general. You will need to become comfortable using GitHub for working on Assignment 2.

We recommend the following additional resources:
GitHub Desktop app user guides and FAQs — https://help.github.com/desktop/
GitHub guides (mainly about the GitHub website), with some good tutorials — https://guides.github.com/
A good tutorial/refresher is the Hello World guide, which covers mainly the things in this Prac, but entirely using the GitHub website. This is useful if you don’t have access to the GitHub Desktop app — https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/</p>
